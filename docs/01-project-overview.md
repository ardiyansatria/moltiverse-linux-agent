# Project Overview

This project is built as part of the Moltiverse Hackathon.

The objective is to build a Linux-based autonomous agent capable of interacting with the Monad blockchain while running in a minimal environment (Android via Termux).

## Why This Project

Most onchain agents are developed and run on full desktop or cloud environments.  
This project explores the feasibility of running an autonomous onchain agent from a lightweight Linux setup, proving accessibility and portability.
